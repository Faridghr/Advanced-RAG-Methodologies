# Advanced RAG Techniques Tutorial

This tutorial explores advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, focusing on practical applications for improving context relevance and answer accuracy in systems like chatbots and virtual assistants. Key topics include:

- **What is RAG?** Understanding the basics of combining search capabilities with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance response quality.
- **Simple RAG Workflow:** A step-by-step guide to the retrieval, augmentation, and generation process.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Detailed explanations of Sentence Window Retrieval and Auto-Merging Retriever methods for efficient index retrieval.
- **Evaluation:** Methods to evaluate the effectiveness of different RAG techniques based on context and answer relevance.

Check out the [Simple-RAG-Chatbot](https://github.com/Faridghr/Simple-RAG-Chatbot) repository for code examples and further details, and the [Evaluating-RAG-Chatbot](https://github.com/Faridghr/Evaluate-RAG-Pipeline) repository for evaluating and implementing these techniques in your projects.
